# Some video encoding scripts I have used.

[**ç®€ä½“ä¸­æ–‡**](README-zh.md)

Thanks for many dalao's help, I was able to learn so much about computer, computer coding, and media processing, then complete these scripts.

But shamefully, the level of these scripts is still not very pretty, and some code was copy & paste from other dalaoðŸ˜‚

Some scripts might be in another disk, I will upload then if I could use the disk.
